## Reporting a Vulnerability

The MarkS3 team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing us at:
**[INSERT SECURITY EMAIL ADDRESS]**

Include the following information in your report:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the issue
- **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Any special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, we will:

1. **Acknowledge receipt** of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. **Provide regular updates** about our progress
3. **Credit you** as the discoverer of the vulnerability (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
4. **Work with you** to understand and resolve the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution Timeline**: Varies based on complexity, but we aim for 30 days for most issues

## Security Measures

MarkS3 implements several security measures to protect users and their data:

### Application Security

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **XSS Protection**: DOMPurify is used to sanitize markdown content
- **CSRF Protection**: SvelteKit's built-in CSRF protection
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks
- **Secure Headers**: Security headers including HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.

### AWS Security

- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito for secure user authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control with least privilege principle
- **Data Encryption**: 
  - Data at rest: S3 server-side encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS)
  - Data in transit: HTTPS/TLS encryption for all communications
- **Access Control**: 
  - S3 bucket policies with strict access controls
  - Cognito identity pools with fine-grained permissions
  - CloudFront signed URLs for sensitive content (when applicable)

### Infrastructure Security

- **Network Security**: 
  - CloudFront CDN with AWS Shield Standard DDoS protection
  - VPC endpoints for private AWS service communication (when applicable)
- **Monitoring**: 
  - CloudTrail for API logging
  - CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting
- **Backup and Recovery**: 
  - S3 versioning for data protection
  - Cross-region replication options

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Deployment Security

1. **AWS Account Security**:
   - Enable MFA on your AWS root account
   - Use IAM users with minimal required permissions
   - Regularly rotate access keys
   - Enable CloudTrail logging

2. **Cognito Configuration**:
   - Use strong password policies
   - Enable MFA for user accounts
   - Configure appropriate session timeouts
   - Use HTTPS-only redirect URLs

3. **S3 Security**:
   - Enable bucket versioning
   - Configure bucket policies carefully
   - Enable access logging
   - Use encryption at rest

4. **Domain and SSL**:
   - Use HTTPS only (redirect HTTP to HTTPS)
   - Implement proper SSL/TLS configuration
   - Use strong cipher suites
   - Enable HSTS headers

### Operational Security

1. **Regular Updates**:
   - Keep MarkS3 updated to the latest version
   - Monitor security advisories
   - Update dependencies regularly

2. **Access Management**:
   - Regularly review user permissions
   - Remove inactive users
   - Use principle of least privilege
   - Monitor access logs

3. **Backup and Recovery**:
   - Regularly test backup procedures
   - Implement cross-region backups for critical data
   - Document recovery procedures

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Client-Side Architecture**: 
   - All authentication tokens are stored client-side
   - Consider the implications for highly sensitive environments

2. **S3 Direct Access**: 
   - Users have direct S3 access through Cognito credentials
   - Ensure proper IAM policies are in place

3. **Markdown Processing**: 
   - While DOMPurify provides XSS protection, be cautious with user-generated content
   - Consider additional content filtering for highly regulated environments

### Recommended Additional Security Measures

For high-security environments, consider:

1. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**:
   - Deploy AWS WAF in front of CloudFront
   - Configure rules to block common attacks

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Set up AWS GuardDuty for threat detection
   - Configure CloudWatch alarms for suspicious activities
   - Implement log analysis and SIEM integration

3. **Network Security**:
   - Use VPC endpoints for AWS service communication
   - Implement network segmentation where applicable

4. **Compliance**:
   - Ensure compliance with relevant standards (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.)
   - Implement audit logging and retention policies

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as follows:

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Immediate patch release
- **High severity**: Within 7 days
- **Medium/Low severity**: Next scheduled release

Security updates will be clearly marked in release notes and announced through:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes
- Project README

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Coordination**: We work with security researchers to understand and fix issues
2. **Timeline**: We aim to fix critical issues within 30 days
3. **Credit**: We provide appropriate credit to researchers (unless they prefer anonymity)
4. **Communication**: We keep researchers informed throughout the process
